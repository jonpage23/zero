This is the build diary of my GBS Zero kit car, a 2 seat Lotus 7 style sports car that uses a Mazda MX-5 as a parts donor. I am doing this ‘blog’ to add another aspect to the project which will hopefully help me keep focused and provide a useful reference for future projects and anyone interested in kit cars.
