Time to get started on this project. I have my Mazda MX-5 in a garage ready to be taken apart, enlisted the help of a friendly mechanic called Mick, and got the tools and a book of instructions that will lead me through the process of taking the parts off the donor car I need. Surely this couldn't be easier, what is all the fuss about?

Well... Let's start with a complete Mazda. All working, running, and actually quite fun to drive.
